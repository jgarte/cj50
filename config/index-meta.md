This course is somewhat inspired by the course [CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science). You can also find its videos [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/cs50/videos). Check those out if you like watching someone else than me for a change. Be mindful that the cs50.h library that they are using is different from cj50.h here, although there are some similarities. cj50 is more concerned with allowing you to make larger programs including graphical programs like simple video games.

If you want to read a book about the C programming language, here are some:

* [The C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie is from the original inventors of C. You can get an old version of the book for free [on archive.org](https://archive.org/details/TheCProgrammingLanguageFirstEdition/mode/2up), but be mindful that this version is not describing the version of C we use today. But the newer editions (not free) are said to be very good to learn C from.

* [Modern C](https://inria.hal.science/hal-02383654/file/ModernC.pdf) is a free book that seems good but is more detailed than we need for this course.
