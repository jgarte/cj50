## uint

```C
typedef unsigned int uint
```

An integer number type that cannot represent negative numbers, but
instead has a little more room in the positive number range than
`int` (0 .. `UINT_MAX`).

CAUTION: arithmetic with numbers of this type does wrap around if
the result of the arithmetic operation is larger than the largest
number that can be represented with this type, or smaller than
0. This is unlike arithmetic with `int`, where such overflows are
an error and (with the compiler options that we use) abort the
program. So it is best to avoid `uint` and always use `int`
instead, except when using functions from libraries or the
operating system that use this type.
